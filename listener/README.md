# Listener

This is a [Deno](https://deno.land) project. It's basically TypeScript with a few things added to and removed from Node to make it nicer to work with.

Its sole purpose is to listen to a [serum-vial server](https://github.com/tardis-dev/serum-vial) and push the messages to [hasura](https://hasura.io/).

It might get changed into something else e.g. TypeScript/Node or Rust in future. Deno is just convenient for now due to how simple it is to set up with Docker.
